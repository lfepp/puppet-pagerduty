puppet-pagerduty
================

Description
-----------

A Puppet report handler for sending notifications of failed runs to
[PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com).  It includes sending all log data
in the `details` section of the API call.

Installation & Usage
-------------------

1. Install this module on your master node: `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet module install pdsupport-pagerduty`

1. Install the gem dependencies on your master node:
    * `/opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/puppetserver gem install puppet`
    * `/opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/puppetserver gem install json`
    * `/opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/puppetserver gem install redphone`

1. Manually install pagerduty.rb to `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/puppet/reports/` by copying the script into the directory.
    This is due to the Puppet issue documented [here](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/SERVER-1014)

1. Create a Puppet specific service that uses the Puppet integration in PagerDuty

1. Add the `pagerduty` class to your master node's main manifest:

         class { 'pagerduty': }

1. List `pagerduty` as a report handler on your master node in `puppet.conf`:

         [master]
         reports = pagerduty

1. Enable pluginsync and reports on your master and client nodes if it is not already:

    You can manually enable in `puppet.conf`:

         [master]
         report = true
         pluginsync = true
         [agent]
         report = true
         pluginsync = true

    Or you can enable within the `pagerduty` class in your master node's manifest:

        class { 'pagerduty':
          pagerduty_puppet_reports    => 'store,http,pagerduty',
          pagerduty_puppet_pluginsync => 'true',
        }

    **Note:** The step above is optional. These settings are `true` by default as of Puppet 3.0.0.

1. Restart the `puppetserver` service

1. Move the `pagerduty.yaml.erb` template into your master node's `confdir` and rename the file `pagerduty.yaml`

        mv /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/pagerduty/templates/pagerduty.yaml.erb /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/pagerduty.yaml

1. Edit your `pagerduty.yaml` file and add your Puppet service's integration key from PagerDuty

        ---
        :pagerduty_api: 'INSERT_INTEGRATION_KEY_HERE'

1. To test that a failed run will trigger a PagerDuty incident, edit the pagerduty moduleâ€™s `init.pp` manifest and uncomment lines 9-13

        if ! defined(Service[$pagerduty_puppet_service]) {
          service { $pagerduty_puppet_service :
            ensure => running,
          }
        }

1. Run the Puppet client and sync the report as a plugin: `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test`
